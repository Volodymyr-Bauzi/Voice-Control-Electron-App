Place your custom Porcupine wake word models here.

To create a custom wake word:
1. Go to Picovoice Console: https://console.picovoice.ai/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new wake word using the Wake Word Creator
4. Download the .ppn file for Windows
5. Rename the file to match your wake word (e.g., "hey_assistant_windows.ppn")
6. Place the file in this directory

The application will automatically detect and use your custom wake word if it matches the wake word setting in the app.

Note: Free Picovoice accounts are limited to 3 custom wake words. For more wake words, you'll need a paid subscription.
